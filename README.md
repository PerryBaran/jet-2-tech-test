## New Skills Learnt While Making This Project

- First time using SASS and a CSS preprocessor in a project.
- Gained a deeper understanding of the BEM methodology.

## What I Would Add If I Had More Time

- Add unit tests to properly test the component.
- Changed how multiple modals are displayed. Either by making them spread out over the page as they're created or make them draggable so you can access multiple modals at once. Currently, each new modal just sits on top of the last.
- Used mixins to remove repetitive CSS code and make the styling more readable.
